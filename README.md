# UK Smoking Case Study  

Exploring smoking behaviours in the UK through data analysis, uncovering socio-economic disparities, consumption patterns, and their implications for public health policies.

## Overview  
This case study explores smoking behaviours in the UK, using real-world data to identify socio-economic disparities, smoking patterns, and their implications for public health. The analysis aligns with the NHS Lung Cancer Screening Programme, assessing how targeted interventions can improve health outcomes.

## Objectives  
- Analyse smoking prevalence across demographic groups  
- Identify associations between smoking habits, income, education, and regional factors  
- Assess the impact of smoking trends on public health initiatives  
- Use data-driven insights to inform smoking cessation strategies and early intervention policies  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [UK Smoking Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/uk-smoking-data/suggestions?status=pending)  
- **Size:** 1,691 records  
- **Features:** Demographic variables (age, gender, income, education, region) and smoking-related data (smoking status, frequency, product use)  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Standardised categorical variables for consistency  
   - Handled missing values and categorised smoking intensity  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis  
   - Power BI visualisations for trends and distributions  
3. **Public Health Assessment**  
   - Analysis of NHS lung cancer screening rollout  
   - Evaluating the role of socio-economic factors in smoking prevalence  

## Key Findings  
- Smoking rates are higher in lower-income and less-educated groups  
- Weekend smoking is more prevalent than weekday smoking, particularly among younger and middle-aged adults  
- Packaged cigarettes are the most preferred product, with some opting for hand-rolled tobacco  
- NHS lung cancer screening focuses on current and former smokers aged 55-74, aiming for early detection and improved survival rates  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** for data cleaning, transformation, visualisation, and dashboard development.  
- **Power Query** for data preprocessing, handling missing values, standardising categorical variables, and transforming smoking intensity categories.  
- **Public health frameworks** for assessing policy impact and evaluating smoking-related health trends.  

## Impact  
This study highlights how data-driven insights can shape public health policies, support smoking cessation programmes, and strengthen early detection initiatives such as the NHS lung cancer screening programme.
